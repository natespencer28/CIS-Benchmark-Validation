## CIS-Benchmark-Validation

CIS, or the Center for Internet Security, has developed CIS Benchmarks to provide best practices for defending against cyber threats across various technology domains. These benchmarks cover over 25 vendor product families, including M365, with the goal of identifying security gaps to protect systems in an ever-evolving threat landscape.

The CIS Benchmark for M365 Environments is located above.
