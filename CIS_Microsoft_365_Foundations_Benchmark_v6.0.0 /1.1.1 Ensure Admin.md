1.1.1 (L1) Ensure Administrative accounts are cloud-only

**Description Administrative accounts are special privileged accounts that could have varying levels of access to data, users, and settings. Regular user accounts should never be utilized for administrative tasks and care should be taken, in the case of a hybrid environment, to keep administrative accounts separate from on-prem accounts.
