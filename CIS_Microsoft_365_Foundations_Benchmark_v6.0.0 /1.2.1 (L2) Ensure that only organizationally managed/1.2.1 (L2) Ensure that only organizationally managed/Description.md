## **1.2.1 (L2) Ensure that only organizationally managed/approved public groups exist**

## 📌 Control Objective
When a new group is created in the Administration panel, the default privacy value of the group is "Public". (In this case, 
‘public’ means accessible to the identities within the organization without requiring group 
owner authorization to join.)

## 🔎 Description
Microsoft 365 Groups is the foundational membership service that drives all teamwork 
across Microsoft 365. With Microsoft 365 Groups, you can give a group of people 
access to a collection of shared resources.

## 🧠 Rationale
Explain **why this control matters**, including:
If group privacy is not controlled, any user may access sensitive information, depending 
on the group they try to access.
