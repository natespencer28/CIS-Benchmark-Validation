# **<1.1.1 (L1) Ensure Administrative accounts are cloud-only>**

## 📌 Control Objective
Regular user accounts should never be utilized 
for administrative tasks and care should be taken, in the case of a hybrid environment, 
to keep administrative accounts separate from on-prem accounts.
---
## 🔎 Description
Administrative users will need to utilize login/logout functionality to switch accounts 
when performing administrative tasks.
---
## 🧠 Rationale
Explain **why this control matters**, including:
- Security principles (Zero Trust, Identity hygiene)
- Relevant attack vectors this control protects against
- Real-world risks if not implemented

Example:
Enforcing this control reduces the attack surface by preventing compromised hybrid accounts from escalating privileges into the cloud environment.
