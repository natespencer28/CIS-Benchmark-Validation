# **1.1.3 (L1) Ensure that between 2 and 4 Global Admins are designated**

## 📌 Control Objective
Between two and four global administrators should be designated in the tenant.
---
## 🔎 Description
If there is only one global administrator, they could perform malicious activities without 
being detected by another admin. Designating multiple global administrators eliminates 
this risk and ensures redundancy
---
## 🧠 Rationale
Explain **why this control matters**, including:
To minimize the attack surface, there should be no more than four global 
admins set for any tenant. A large number of global admins increases the likelihood of a 
successful account breach by an external attacker.
