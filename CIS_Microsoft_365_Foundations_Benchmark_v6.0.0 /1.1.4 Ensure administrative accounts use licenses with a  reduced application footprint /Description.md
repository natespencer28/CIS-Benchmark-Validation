# **1.1.4 (L1) Ensure administrative accounts use licenses with a reduced application footprint**

## 📌 Control Objective
The recommended state is to not license a privileged account or use licenses without 
associated applications such as Microsoft Entra ID P1 or Microsoft Entra ID 
P2. 
---
## 🔎 Description
Administrative accounts are special privileged accounts that could have varying levels 
of access to data, users, and settings. A license can enable an account to gain access 
to a variety of different applications, depending on the license assigned. 
---
## 🧠 Rationale
Explain **why this control matters**, including:
Ensuring administrative accounts do not use licenses with applications assigned to 
them will reduce the attack surface of high privileged identities in the organization's 
environment
