## 1.3.3 (L2) Ensure 'External sharing' of calendars is not available 

## 📌 Control Objective
Ensure 'External sharing' of calendars is not available 

## 🔎 Description
External calendar sharing allows an administrator to enable the ability for users to share 
calendars with anyone outside of the organization. Outside users will be sent a URL that 
can be used to view the calendar. 

## 🧠 Rationale
Attackers often spend time learning about organizations before launching an attack. 
Publicly available calendars can help attackers understand organizational relationships 
and determine when specific users may be more vulnerable to an attack, such as when 
they are traveling.
