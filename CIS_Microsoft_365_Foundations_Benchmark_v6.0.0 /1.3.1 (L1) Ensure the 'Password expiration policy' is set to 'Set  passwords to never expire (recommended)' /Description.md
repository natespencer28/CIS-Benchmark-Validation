## 1.3.1 (L1) Ensure the 'Password expiration policy' is set to 'Set 
passwords to never expire (recommended)'

## 📌 Control Objective
Ensure the 'Password expiration policy' is set to 'Set 
passwords to never expire 

## 🔎 Description
Microsoft cloud-only accounts have a pre-defined password policy that cannot be 
changed. The only items that can change are the number of days until a password 
expires and whether or whether passwords expire at all. 

## 🧠 Rationale
Organizations such as NIST and Microsoft have updated their password policy 
recommendations to not arbitrarily require users to change their passwords after a 
specific amount of time, unless there is evidence that the password is compromised, or 
the user forgot it.
